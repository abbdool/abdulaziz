# Abdul Aziz

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm **Abdul Aziz**, a passionate and curious **Computer Science student** at **BINUS University**. Currently pursuing my **Bachelor's degree (S1)**, I'm on a journey to explore the endless possibilities of technology and programming.

ðŸ’» As a **coding enthusiast**, I'm diving into the fundamentals of **C and C++**, building a strong foundation to tackle more complex challenges in the future. I also enjoy exploring **how things work under the hood** (reverse engineering) and **securing systems** (network security) in my free time. Basically, I love solving puzzles and figuring out how to make things better and safer.

â˜• When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me enjoying a cup of **black coffee** while brainstorming new ideas or debugging my latest project. Coffee + coding = my perfect combo!
